-- expected that the notes on beat 1.5 2.5 3.5 4.5, in the ff section, does not appear,
-- to prove that the conduction rules apply correctly:
-- notes on 1, 2, 3, 4 will be set to velocity = 100
-- all other notes are 50 less than its predecessors
-- all notes with the expression ff will be decreased by velocity 50
